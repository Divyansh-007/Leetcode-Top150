## How to Use This Repository

1. **Problem Descriptions**: Each problem is organized into its own directory. Inside each directory, you'll find a Markdown file with the problem description, constraints, and examples.

2. **Solutions**: The "solutions" directory contains solutions to each problem in various programming languages. It's recommended to first attempt solving the problems on your own before referring to the solutions.

3. **Contributions**: Feel free to contribute your own solutions or improvements to existing ones. Follow the guidelines in the "CONTRIBUTING.md" file for more details on how to contribute.

## Table of Contents

1. [Merge Sorted Array](/problems/arrays-n-strings/mergeSortedArray/)

   - **Description**: You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

   Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

   The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

   - **Difficulty**: Easy
   - **Languages**:
     - [java](/problems/arrays-n-strings/mergeSortedArray/javaVersion.java)
     - [typescript](/problems/arrays-n-strings/mergeSortedArray/TsVersion.ts)
